# matrixbitset

## Description:
Implements a matrix view of a BitSet. This allows some matrix ops and handles a nice 64 to 1 compression of some set of row/col data.
I am forever indebted to Will Fitzgerald <will.fitzgerald@gmail.com> for pioneering the BitSet work that I borrowed
from his excellent library <https://github.com/willf/bitset>
